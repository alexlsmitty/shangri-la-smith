# Social Media Assets

## OpenGraph Image

An OpenGraph image is needed for social media sharing. This image should be:

- 1200x630 pixels
- JPG or PNG format
- Under 200KB in size
- Named `og-image.jpg` or `og-image.png`
- Placed in this directory

You can create this image using any image editing software by:

1. Using one of the resort's high-quality beach or resort photos as the background
2. Adding the Shangri-La Beach Resort logo in white over the image
3. Optionally adding a tagline such as "Your Luxury Paradise Awaits"
4. Ensuring good contrast between the background and the text elements

Once created, update the path in index.html if necessary:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="/meta/og-image.jpg">
```

This image will be displayed when links to the site are shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
